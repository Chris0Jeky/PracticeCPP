# C++ Practice: 
Input/Output: Write a program that reads two numbers from the keyboard using cin, adds them together, and prints the result to the console using cout.

Strings: Write a program that reads a string from the keyboard using cin, reverses the string, and prints the reversed string to the console using cout.

Vectors: Write a program that reads a sequence of numbers from the keyboard using cin, stores them in a vector, sorts the vector in ascending order using sort,
and prints the sorted vector to the console using cout.

Pairs: Write a program that reads a sequence of pairs of numbers from the keyboard using cin, stores them in a vector of pair objects,
sorts the vector based on the first element of each pair using sort, and prints the sorted vector to the console using cout.

Maps: Write a program that reads a sequence of words from the keyboard using cin, stores them in a map, and prints the frequency of each word to the console using cout.

Sets: Write a program that reads a sequence of numbers from the keyboard using cin, stores them in a set, and prints the unique elements of the set to the console using cout.

Min/Max: Write a program that reads a sequence of numbers from the keyboard using cin, stores them in a vector, and prints the minimum and maximum values in the vector to the console using cout.

Math Functions: Write a program that reads a number from the keyboard using cin, calculates the square root of the number using sqrt, raises the number to the power of 2 using pow, and finds the absolute value of the number using abs.
Print the results to the console using cout.
